# Practical 8

This folder contains the innformation about the Practical 8
## Overview

This program implements both iterative and recursive versions of Euclid's algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers.

## Compilation and Execution

### Compilation Steps

1. Compile the program using `gcc`:
   gcc gcd.c -o gcd.C

### Executions

1. Execution of the program :
  - ./gcdC

### Results 

1. Output of the program :

Please enter two positive integers :
   - IterativeGCD(10, 6) = 2
   - RecursiveGCD(10, 6) = 2
